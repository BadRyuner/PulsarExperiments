# PulsarExperiments

An example of the implementation of scary things. (Scary - because the code is scary, very scary)

# Examples
- Melee Weapon (with pseudo-api, 2 with primitive logic + 1 with special logic)
- Custom Gun (just with custom prefab, 1 item)
- Custom Item (code + prefab, Engineer Table)
- Space Drone (just code & prefab)
- Custom Faces (for robots only, special patch + code)

# Used

[ThunderKit](https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit) - game dll import & asset build script
[PML](https://github.com/PULSAR-Modders/pulsar-mod-loader) - modding api

# It is important
After importing the meshes into Unity, you need to set Read/Write to true.

# Build Unity Bundle

In Unity Editor:
1) You need to select the path to the game exe in the ThunderKit settings and click Import.  There may be errors in AssemblyCsharp if PML is installed.  If there is an error, delete pml dll from Pulsar/Packages/PulsarLostColony/PulsarModLoader.dll, or try importing the dll from a clean version of the game.
2) Select Pipe file in Assets and change path to your mods directory
3) Click Execute in Pipe file
4) üëç

Possible problems:
1) After restarting unity, errors may appear due to missing scripts.  Just delete the Pulsar/Packages/PulsarLostColony folder and click Import again in ThunderKit. And copy again PulsarExperiments.dll to Pulsar/Assets/
